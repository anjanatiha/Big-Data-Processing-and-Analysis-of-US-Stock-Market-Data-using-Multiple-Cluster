### Description
1. Developed architecture for preprocessing and analysis of 7 years of historical US stock market data (50 TB).
2. Extracted information from raw data files based on field length specifications available on US Stock Exchange for multiple years and file formats with nanosecond granularity.
3. Preprocessed and analyzed data on multiple clusters with Apache Spark for reducing time complexity.
4. Conducted stock market data analysis (multi-market analysis for market dominance) and anomaly detection (Flash crash day - May 6, 2010, and August 24, 2015) and generated visualization and report.
5. Proposed using unsupervised learning/clustering on large-scale unlabeled stock market data for anomaly detection and general market analysis in absence of labels.
